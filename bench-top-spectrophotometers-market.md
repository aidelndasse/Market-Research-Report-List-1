<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bench-Top Spectrophotometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-beam</li><li>Double-beam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bench-top spectrophotometers are essential instruments used for measuring light absorbance in various samples. The market primarily consists of two types: single-beam and double-beam spectrophotometers. Single-beam spectrophotometers measure light intensity before and after passing through the sample in a single pathway, making them simpler and more cost-effective. In contrast, double-beam spectrophotometers split the light into two beams, one passing through the sample and the other through a reference, allowing for higher precision and stability in measurements, especially in variable light conditions.</p></p>
