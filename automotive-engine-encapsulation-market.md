<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Engine Encapsulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Engine-mounted</li><li>Body-mounted</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive engine encapsulation market is divided into two main types: engine-mounted and body-mounted systems. Engine-mounted encapsulation involves housing the engine within a tailored acoustic cover that minimizes noise and vibration directly at the source. In contrast, body-mounted encapsulation utilizes materials and structures integrated into the vehicle's chassis or body to absorb sound and reduce vibrations from the engine. Both approaches aim to improve passenger comfort and vehicle performance by enhancing noise reduction and thermal management.</p></p>
