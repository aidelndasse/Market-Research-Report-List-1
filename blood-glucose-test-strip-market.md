<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Glucose Test Strip Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glucose Oxidase</li><li>Glucose Dehydrogenase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The blood glucose test strip market is primarily categorized into two types: glucose oxidase and glucose dehydrogenase. Glucose oxidase strips use the enzyme glucose oxidase to catalyze the oxidation of glucose, producing hydrogen peroxide, which is then measured for glucose levels. In contrast, glucose dehydrogenase strips employ glucose dehydrogenase to facilitate the conversion of glucose into gluconolactone, with a corresponding reduction in NAD+ to NADH, also measured to determine glucose concentration. Both types offer accuracy and efficiency for diabetes management.</p></p>
