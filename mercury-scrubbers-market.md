<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mercury Scrubbers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Scrubbers</li><li>Wet Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mercury scrubbers market consists of two primary types: dry scrubbers and wet scrubbers. Dry scrubbers utilize solid sorbents to capture mercury from flue gases, offering advantages like lower water usage and simpler maintenance. Conversely, wet scrubbers employ liquid solutions, often removing mercury through chemical reactions or absorption, and are effective in handling larger volumes of pollutants. Both technologies are critical in reducing mercury emissions from industrial processes, contributing to environmental protection and regulatory compliance.</p></p>
