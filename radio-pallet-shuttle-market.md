<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio Pallet Shuttle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FIFO (First in First out)</li><li>LIFO (Last in First out)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radio Pallet Shuttle systems operate using two primary inventory management types: FIFO (First In, First Out) and LIFO (Last In, First Out). FIFO prioritizes the use of older stock first, ensuring products remain fresh and reducing the risk of obsolescence. In contrast, LIFO allows newer items to be picked first, often used for goods with longer shelf lives or in bulk storage. Both methods enhance warehouse efficiency, optimize space utilization, and support effective inventory turnover according to specific operational needs.</p></p>
